"""
Central application configuration.

Everything that might change between environments (dev / staging / production)
or between deployments (different clinic, different database, different domain)
lives here and is read from environment variables (see .env.example).

This is the ONLY file that should read os.environ directly - every other
module should import `settings` from here.
